# DistributedBitmapIndexingEngine
## What?
This project is for creating a distributed index comprised of bitmap vectors. It will support
* bitmap query completion (ANDs/ORs)
* joins
Originally DBIE was implemented in C, but we are moving it to Java for 2020 and onward publication submissions.

## Calling Rust experts
Rust experts with experience writing microservices would also be appreciated for contributions as we aim to make this
system more optimized.

## Acknowledgements
This work is based on that completed by David Chiu, Sam Burdick, Jahrme Risner, Jason Sawin, and many others. The
distributed portion was published at [BDCAT 2018](https://mathcs.pugetsound.edu/~dchiu/research/Papers/burdick-BDCAT2018.pdf).
